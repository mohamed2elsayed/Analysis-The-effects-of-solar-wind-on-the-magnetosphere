<p>
  This project evaluates large datasets to identify trends and develop actionable insights related to the effects of solar wind on the Earth's magnetosphere.
</p>

<h2>Key Activities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Search and build 54 datasets for 27 years to a scientific event on The Earthâ€™s Magnetosphere.</li>
  <li>Build subplots for all 54 datasets, and study them to find relation.</li>
  <li>Assembled visual representations of data with charts, graphs, or infographics.</li>
  <li>Calculate radius magnetopause for all 54 datasets and study these events.</li>
  <li>Build a dataset including 27 years of scientific events and make a group for all the top events that happened each year and take the lowest radius magnetopause.</li>
  <li>Apply time series prediction and predict data 2023:2030 to complete 25 solar cycle.</li>
  <li>Make a report to show the powerful events that happened in the 23,24,25 solar cycle at which month.</li>
</ul>
